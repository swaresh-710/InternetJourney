          <h2>Early Age of the Internet</h2>

          <p>
            In the early days of the internet, a groundbreaking era known as
            Web1 emerged with birth of the World Wide Web. Sir Tim Berners-Lee
            in the late 1980s introduced key technologies like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">
              Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            </a>
            (HTTP) and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"
              >Hypertext Markup Language</a
            >
            (HTML), changed the way information was accessed and shared. With
            the introduction of web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
            the web became accessible to the general public. Web1 brought an
            abundance of websites that became the gateways to a world of
            knowledge. Organizations, businesses, and individuals could create
            their own web pages and share information globally. The concept of
            online directories, such as Yahoo!, emerged, providing users with
            categorized lists of websites and making it easier to navigate the
            expanding digital landscape. Email became a ubiquitous form of
            communication during the Web1 era. People could exchange messages
            instantly, regardless of their physical location. The concept of
            online forums and discussion boards further facilitated
            communication and knowledge sharing. It also Introduced Search
            engines, which became the go-to tools for finding information on the
            vast web and thanks to Web1 we got concept of E-commerce and Online
            Shopping. Though it created foundation of whatever we are able to do
            with it today, it still was just 1st iteration and like our pose it
            is never perfect in 1st, 2nd, 3rd attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The early age of the internet, also known as Web1, refers to the
            initial phase of the World Wide Web and its development.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period, the internet was primarily used for basic
            communication and information sharing. Key features of this era
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dial-up internet connections</li>
            <li>
              HTML and early web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator
            </li>
            <li>Static web pages with limited interactivity</li>
            <li>Websites with simple designs and minimal graphics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Web1 laid the foundation for the rapid expansion and evolution of
            the internet, setting the stage for future advancements in
            technology, communication, and online experiences.

                <b>
                  Web3 was developed as a response to the limitations of Web2,
                  aiming to address various issues and provide a more
                  decentralized and user-centric internet experience.

                Web2 platforms are typically centralized, control are
                concentrated in the hands of a few entities. In Web2, users
                often face a lack of control over their personal information and
                limited transparency regarding how their data is used.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>
                  It seeks to solve problems related to centralized control,
                  lack of privacy, and data ownership, enabling individuals to
                  have more control over their online presence and transactions.

                <br />
                Web3 aims to decentralize control by leveraging blockchain
                technology and decentralized networks. It empowers users by
                enabling peer-to-peer interactions, eliminating intermediaries,
                and allowing individuals to have more ownership and control over
                their data and digital assets.

              <p>
                Web3 works by leveraging blockchain technology, decentralized
                networks, and smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer
                interactions, secure transactions, and the creation and
                ownership of digital assets.
